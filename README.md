# Fake Bank Note Detection using Logistic Regression(in R)
To identify whether a bank note is fake or not, based on features that were extracted from the images using wavelet transforms.

Did some EDA to find good features that can be used to build the classifier.

Did some feature engineering to improve the accuracy of the classifier.
Showed some visualization for comparing the classifier that uses linear terms of the features and the classifier that uses quadratic terms of the features
